title: Context API V/s Redux Toolkit
---

Context API vs Redux Toolkit in React — both are used for state management, but they solve slightly different problems.

### ⚡ Context API

- ✅ What it is:
  - A **built-in feature** in React for passing data through the component tree without prop drilling.
  - Good for **small or medium apps** where global state is limited. (eg: theme, user auth, language, etc)
- ✅ How it works:
  - Create a `context`.
  - Wrap the component with a `Provider` to share state.
  - Consume state using `useContext`.
- Example:

  ```
      const ThemeContext = React.createContext();
      const App = () => {
          const [theme, setTheme] = React.useState('light')
          return(
              <ThemeContext.Provider value={{theme, setTheme}}>
                  <Child/>
              </ThemeContext.Provider>
          )
      }

      const Child = () => {
          const {theme, setTheme} = React.useContext(ThemeContext)
          return (
              <div>
                  <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
                  <button onClick={() => setTheme("dark")}>Dark Mode</button>
              </div>
          )
      }
  ```

- 👉 Use when you need simple global state sharing without extra libraries.

### ⚡ Redux Toolkit

- ✅ What it is:
  - A **state management** library built on top of Redux.
  - Solves issues like **boilerplate, immutability and complex reducers**.
  - Best for **large apps** with complex state logic (API data, caching, user flows).
- ✅ How it works:
  - Create a store using `configStore`.
  - Create slices (`createSlice`) with reducers.
  - Use `useSelector` to read and `useDispatch` to update state.
- Example:

```
    // Import
    import {createSlice, configStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
    import {useSelector, useDispatch, Provider} from 'react-redux'

    const themeSlice = createSlice({
        name: 'theme',
        initialState: {value: 'light'},
        reducers: {
            setDark: (state) => {state.value = 'dark' },
            setLight: (state) => {state.value = 'light' }
        }
    })

    const store = configStore({reducer: {theme: themeSlice.reducers}});

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <Provider store={store}>
                <Child/>
            </Provider>
        )
    }

    const Child = () => {
        const dispatch = useDispatch()
        const theme = useSelector((state)=> state.theme.value)
        return (
            <>
                <p>Theme: {theme}</p>
                <button onClick={()=> {dispatch(themeSlice.actions.setDark())}}>Dark Mode</button>
            </>
        )
    }
```

- 👉 Use when your app has complex state, **many components depending on the same data**, or you need **predictable state debugging (Redux DevTools)**.

| Boilerplate           | Low                                    | Medium (simplified by RTK)              |

| Async handling (API)  | ❌ Manual                              | ✅ Built-in with `createAsyncThunk`     |
| Best for              | Small/medium apps, simple global state | Large/complex apps, scalable state mgmt |

### 🧠 Interview One-liner

_"I use Context API for small-scale state like theme or auth. For large apps with complex logic I prefer Redux toolkit
because it gives structure, middleware and DevTools for debugging."_

### ⚡ Context API vs Redux Toolkit – Interview Scenarios

- Q1: **Your app only needs to share a logged-in user’s info (name, email, role) across a few components. Which would you use?**

  - 👉 Answer: Context API.
  - Because it’s lightweight, built-in, and enough for small state like auth or theme. Redux Toolkit would be overkill.

- Q2: **You’re building an e-commerce app with cart, products, filters, orders, and wishlists. Data updates frequently and many components depend on it. Which do you use?**

  - 👉 Answer: Redux Toolkit.
  - Because multiple components need the same state, updates are frequent, and you want debugging tools like Redux DevTools.

- Q3: **You need to manage a dark/light theme toggle across the app. Which do you use?**

  - 👉 Answer: Context API.
  - Simple global state → Context API is perfect.

- Q4: **Your app fetches data from APIs (e.g., product list, user details) and you want to handle loading, success, and error states. Which do you use?**

  - 👉 Answer: Redux Toolkit.
  - Because createAsyncThunk + slices make API state management clean and predictable.

- Q5: **Your app has only 2–3 global states, but you want time-travel debugging to track how state changed over time. Which do you use?**

  - 👉 Answer: Redux Toolkit.
  - Redux DevTools allow you to inspect, replay, and debug state changes.

- Q6: **You are working in a team project where multiple developers need consistent state structure and maintainability. Which do you use?**

  - 👉 Answer: Redux Toolkit.
  - Because it enforces structured state management and reduces bugs.

### ⚡ Quick Rule of Thumb

- ✅ Use **Context API** for → Auth state, theme toggles, language, or when state is small and simple.
- ✅ Use **Redux Toolkit** for → Large apps, async API data, debugging, and team projects.

### 🧠 Interview Trick Question

- Q: **“Can Context API completely replace Redux?”**
  - 👉 Answer:
    _“Not really. Context API only solves prop drilling. It doesn’t provide middleware, async handling, or debugging
    tools like Redux Toolkit. For small state → Context is fine, but for scalable apps → Redux Toolkit is better.”_

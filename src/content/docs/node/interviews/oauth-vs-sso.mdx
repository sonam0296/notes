title: OAuth vs SSO
---

### üîπ 1. OAuth (Open Authorization)

- OAuth is an **authorization protocol** that allows one app to access resources (like data or APIs) from another
  app **on behalf of the user**, without sharing credentials.

##### ‚öôÔ∏è How it works (OAuth 2.0 flow ‚Äì simplified):

- 1. User clicks **Login with Google** on your app.
- 2. Your app will redirect user to **Google's OAuth server**.
- 3. User logs into Google and give consent (e.g., "allow access to email").
- 4. Google sends an **authorization code** back to your app.
- 5. Your app exchange the code for an **access token**.
- 6. Your app uses the access token to call Google API's (e.g., fetch user profile).

##### ‚úÖ Pros:

- Delegated access(your app doesn't see the user's Google password).
- Secure ways for apps to interact with each other.
- Scopes (fine-grained access control: email, profile, calendar, etc.).

##### ‚ùå Cons:

- Can be complex to implement correctly.
- Only handle **authorization**, not authentication by itself (though OpenID Connect adds authentication).

#### Example:

- ‚ÄúAllow Spotify to access your Google contacts‚Äù ‚Üí That‚Äôs OAuth.

### üîπ 2. SSO (Single Sign-On)

- SSO is an **authentication method** that allows user to log in **once** and gain access to **multiple apps** without
  logging in again.

##### ‚öôÔ∏è How it works:

- You log in once at a **central identity provider(IdP)** (eg. Okta, Microsoft, Google).
- The IdP creates a **session/token** for you.
- When you access another app that trusts the same IdP, you're already authenticated.
- You don't need to enter your credentials again -> you're automatically logged in.

##### ‚úÖ Pros:

- Great user experience (one login for many apps).
- Centralized authentication (security, policies in one place).
- Works with SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect under the hood.

##### ‚ùå Cons:

- If the IdP goes down ‚Üí all apps are affected.
- Single point of attack if not secured properly.

#### Example:

- You log in to your company portal ‚Üí automatically get access to Gmail, Slack, Jira, GitHub (all integrated via SSO).

### üîπ Key Differences

| Feature         | **OAuth**                                          | **SSO**                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Authorization (delegated access to resources)      | Authentication (log in once, access multiple apps) |
| **Scope**       | API access (e.g., Google Drive, Spotify)           | User identity across apps                          |
| **Who uses it** | Third-party apps (your app ‚Üí Google/Facebook APIs) | Enterprises & organizations                        |
| **Protocol**    | OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect                          | Can use SAML, OAuth 2.0, OIDC                      |
| **Example**     | ‚ÄúAllow Trello to access your Google Drive‚Äù         | Login once ‚Üí access Gmail, Calendar, Drive         |

### üîπ How They Work Together

- **OAuth** = lets apps access resources on your behalf.
- **SSO** = lets you log in once for multiple apps.

##### üëâ Many modern SSO systems **use OAuth (with OpenID Connect)** under the hood for authentication + authorization.

#### For example:

- Login with Google (SSO for all Google services) uses OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect.
- Corporate SSO (Okta, Auth0, Azure AD) often uses SAML or OIDC.

### ‚ö° Real-world analogy:

- **OAuth** = ‚ÄúI give my friend the house key only for the garage, not the whole house.‚Äù
- **SSO** = ‚ÄúI unlock my house once, and all rooms are open for me.‚Äù

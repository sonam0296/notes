#### Two Sum Problem: The Ultimate Dating App Algorithm 💕

### The Story

- Imagine you're a matchmaker for numbers! Your job is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target value. It's like Tinder, but for math.

### The Drama 🎬

- **Naive Approach :** Let me check for **EVERY** possible pair! _O(n²) complexity enters the chat_ 😱
- **Smart Approach :** I will use a **Map** as my little black book! _O(n) complexity winks_ 😎

### The Algorithm (aka "The Wingman Strategy")

- **Meet and Greet :** Walk through the array one number at a time.
- **Calculate Compatibility :** For each number, calculate what its "perfect match" would be `(target - curr_number)`
- **Check Your Contacts :** Look into your Map to see if you've already met this perfect match.
- **Match Found :** If yes, return both indices and play Cupid 💘
- **Add to Contacts :** If no, add current number to your Map and keep searching.

### The Punchline 🤡

```
// Before: "I need to check everyone with everyone!"
// After: "I remember everyone I've met, so I only need one pass!"
```

### Fun Fact

- Your solution return `[-1, -1]` if no pair found, which is like saying, _"Sorry, no match found on this dating app!"_

### Memory Palace 🧠

- **Map =** Your contact list (remember who you've seen)
- **diff =** The Perfect partner you were looking for!
- **One pass =** Speed dating efficiency!

##### _Complexity : O(n) time and O(n) space - because being efficient is sexy!_ ✨

### The Actual Code (Your Masterpiece) 🎨

```
    const twoSum = (nums, target) => {
        let map = new Map()
        for(let i =0; i<nums.length; i++){
            let diff = target - nums[i]
            if(map.has(diff)){
                return [map.get(diff), i]
            }
            map.set(nums[i], i)
        }
        return [-1, -1]
    }
```

### Test Drive 🚗

```
// Example: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
// Step 1: See 2, looking for 7, don't have 7 yet → save 2
// Step 2: See 7, looking for 2, found 2 at index 0! → return [0,1] 🎯
```

#### Move Zeroes: The Great Zero Migration 🚚💨

### The Story

- You're organizing a library where all the empty spaces (zeroes) need to move to the back, but you must keep all the books (non-zero numbers) in their original order. It's like being a librarian with OCD! 📚

### The Drama 🎬

- **Naive Approach :** "Let me create a new array and copy things over!" _Extra space police sirens_ 🚨
- **Smart Approach :** "I'll use two pointers to shuffle things in-place!" _O(1) space walks in like a boss_ 😎

## The Naive/Brute Force Approach 🐌

- _"When you overthink a simple problem"_
-

```
    // The "I need extra space" approach
    const moveZeroesNaive = (nums) => {
        let result = []
        let zeros = []
        // First pass: Collect non-zeros and zeros separately
        for(let i=0; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i] !== 0){
                result.push(nums[i])    // Non-zeros go first
            }
            else {
                zeros.push(nums[i])     // Zeros go in separate pile
            }
        }
        // Combine them
        const finalArray = [...result, ...zeros]
        // Copy back to original array (since we need to modify in-place)
        for(let i=0; i<finalArray.length; i++){
            nums[i] = finalArray[i]
        }
    }
```

- **What's wrong with this?**

  - **Extra Space :** O(n) space for temporary arrays (like renting a storage unit to reorganize your closet!)
  - **Multiple Passes :** We scan the array multiple times
  - **Unnecessary Copying :** We create new arrays just to copy back

- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space 😵

### The Algorithm (aka "The Conveyor Belt Strategy")

- 1. Setup Two Workers: One pointer (`left`) finds empty spots, another (`right`) finds books to move
- 2. The Rules:

     - `left` always points to the first zero (empty spot)
     - `right` scans ahead looking for non-zero values (books)

- 3.The Action: When `right` finds a book, swap it with the empty spot at `left`
- 4. Keep Going: Continue until all books are moved forward and all empty spaces are at the end

### The Punchline 🤡

```
// It's like having a bouncer who kicks out all the zeroes to the back of the club,
// but lets all the VIP numbers keep their relative positions!
```

## The Two-Pointer Dance 💃🕺

### **Method 1: The "Swap Dance"**

```
    const moveZeros = (nums) => {
        let left = 0         // Points to first zero (empty spot)

        for(let right = 0; right<nums.length; right++){
            if(nums[right] !== 0){
                [nums[left], nums[right]] = [nums[right], nums[left]]       // Found a non-zero! Swap with the empty spot
                left++      // Move to next potential empty spot
            }
        }
    }
```

**What's happening:**

- `left` is like a parking spot reservation for non-zero values
- Every time we find a non-zero, we "park" it at the `left` position
- Zeroes naturally get pushed to the `right`!

### **Method 1: The "Bulldozer Approach"**

```
var moveZeroes = function(nums) {
    let writeIndex = 0;  // Where to place next non-zero

    // First pass: Move all non-zeroes forward
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== 0) {
            nums[writeIndex] = nums[i];
            writeIndex++;
        }
    }

    // Second pass: Fill remaining with zeroes
    for (let i = writeIndex; i < nums.length; i++) {
        nums[i] = 0;
    }
};
```

**What's happening:**

- First, bulldoze all non-zero values to the front
- Then, fill the rest with zeroes like painting a wall!

### Test Drive 🚗

```
// Example: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
//
// Using Method 1 (Swap Dance):
// Initial: [0,1,0,3,12], left=0, right=0
// right=0: nums[0]=0, skip
// right=1: nums[1]=1≠0, swap with left=0 → [1,0,0,3,12], left=1
// right=2: nums[2]=0, skip
// right=3: nums[3]=3≠0, swap with left=1 → [1,3,0,0,12], left=2
// right=4: nums[4]=12≠0, swap with left=2 → [1,3,12,0,0], left=3
// Result: [1,3,12,0,0] ✨
```

### The Psychology 🧠

- **Two Pointers Pattern:** Perfect for in-place array manipulation
- **Stable Sort:** Non-zero elements maintain their relative order (like a gentle librarian)
- **In-Place:** No extra space needed (like reorganizing your room without buying new furniture)

### Complexity Report Card 📊

- **Time:** O(n) - "I visit each element once, like a efficient postal worker"
- **Space:** O(1) - "I work with what I've got, no extra storage needed"
- **Stability:** ✅ - "Non-zero elements keep their original order, like a respectful queue"

### Memory Palace 🏰

- **left pointer =** The Organizer (always knows where the next item should go)
- **right pointer =** The Scout (searches for items to organize)
- **Swap =** The Magic Teleportation (instantly moves items to their proper place)
